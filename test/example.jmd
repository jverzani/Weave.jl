# A sample document to convert from markdown into HTML with julia embedded


The `Weave` package is basically a simple rewrapping of the `Gadfly.weave` file from the `Gadfly` package of Daniel C. Jones. A few added features are the use of `GoogleCharts` for graphing and the ability to do simple self-grading quizzes.

## adding `Julia` code:

We have  The basic markup looks like this:

<pre>
<code>
~~~{.julia}
2 + 2
~~~
</code>
</pre>

And renders as follows:

~~~{.julia}
2 + 2
~~~


That is, wrap `julia` code in triple tilde brackets (fenced code blocks) and specify it as `julia` code.

We can print within a code block:

~~~{.julia}
for i in 1:3
  println(i)
end
~~~


## Graphics

One can embed `GoogleCharts`:

~~~{.julia}
using GoogleCharts
plot([sin, x -> cos(x) > 0 ? 0 : NaN], 0, pi)
~~~

`GoogleCharts` might be suitable for web pages, but would not be suitable for LaTeX or other outputs

Gadfly graphics can be done as follows

~~~{#blockid .julia}
using Gadfly
using Compose
using RDatasets

iris = data("datasets", "iris"); 
Gadfly.plot(sin, 0, pi)
~~~

Or using this style you can control the size:

~~~{.julia}
p = Gadfly.plot(cos, 0, pi);
draw(SVG(4inch, 3inch), p)
~~~

Don't forget the semi-colon after `p=...` or the graphic will render twice.

Winston graphics should be easy too, but for now that is broken.

**Need to get graphics working with LaTeX**


## block options

Block options include execute and hide They are specified as:

`{#blockid .julia execute="false" hide="true"}`


## Inline code

Does inline code work `x`? what about `4 + 4`{.julia}? (is that 8?) 


## other languages

**need execute="false", julia is the default**

~~~{.python execute="false"}
this_shouldnt_call_anything_as_we_did: execute="false"
~~~

** this doesn't work with LaTeX output **

## Bootstrap styling for HTML pages

The bootstrap css is here for web pages. Pandoc makes it easy to integrate HTML and markdown.

#### page header class

<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Example page header <small>Subtext for header</small></h1>
</div>

#### Icons

<i class="icon-search"></i> 

#### Labels

<span class="label">Default</span>

#### alerts (note markup embedded in HTML)

<div class="alert">
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&times;</button>
  **Warning!** Best check yo self, you're not looking too good.
</div>




## Quizzes. 

There is code to use a modified `showdown.js` file to do simple self grading quizzes.

<script type="text/markdown">

* What is 1 + 1?

Q1 = ___[2]

* What is 2 + 2?

Q2 = () 3 (x) 4 () 5

* Which values (one or more) are larger than 6?

Q3 = [] 5 [] 6 [x] 7 [x] 8

* Select the value larger that `pi`

Q4 = {2, 3, (4)}

</script>
